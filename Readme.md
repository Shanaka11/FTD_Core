# FTD Core

Core Package to help Generate Code fot FTD Application Development framework.
This will use a defined schema to generate core functionality

## Features

    - Generate base code using a defined schema
    - Follows clean architecture patterns to maximize portability
    - Users will only need to maintain essential code (Business logic) in their repository as the rest will be generated by this tool

## Getting Started

    - Run the following code to install and initiate the FTDCore package in your local project
        """
        npx @five12days/core --init
        """
    - Or you can manually setup FTDCore by using the following steps
      - run
        """
        npm install @five12days/core
        """
      - add "ftd:init" : "frd_core --init" to the scripts in package.json
      - add "ftd:generate" : 'ftd_core --generate" to the scripts in package.json
      - run
        """
        npm run ftd:init
        """
    - Define the schema files according to the definitions
    - Once the definitions are done run the following command
      """
      npm run ftd:generate
      """
    - To enable schema parsing in VS code add the following lines to in the json:schema section of the settings page and make sure that json schema download is enabled
      """
        {
          "fileMatch": ["/*.ftd.json"],
          "url": "https://five12daysgeneral.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ftd-core/ftdModel.schema.json"
        },
        {
          "fileMatch": ["ftd_config.json"],
			    "url": "https://five12daysgeneral.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ftd-core/ftdConfig.schema.json"
        }
      """

## Schema definition

    TODO

## Roadmap

    - Phase 1
      - Generate model files
      - Generate crud use cases
    - Phase 2
      - Generate db Schema (Prisma / Drizzle / Others?)
    - Phase 3
      - Generate ZOD validation schema
      - Generate model types from ZOD schema
      - Generate validate methods
    - Phase 4
      - Generate stubs to wrap core use cases to add business logic
    - Phase 5
      - Create a GUI to generate the GUI
