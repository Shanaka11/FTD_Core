# FTD Core

Core Package to help Generate Code fot FTD Application Development framework.
This will use a defined schema to generate core functionality

## Features

    - Generate base code using a defined schema
    - Follows clean architecture patterns to maximize portability
    - Users will only need to maintain essential code (Business logic) in their repository as the rest will be generated by this tool

## Getting Started

    - Run the following code to install and initiate the FTDCore package in your local project
        """
        npx @five12days/core --init
        """

      - run
        """
        npm install @five12days/core
        """
      - add "ftd:init" : "frd_core --init" to the scripts in package.json
      - add "ftd:generate" : 'ftd_core --generate" to the scripts in package.json
      - run
        """
        npm run ftd:init
        """
    - Define the schema files according to the definitions
    - Once the definitions are done run the following command
      """
      npm run ftd:generate
      """
